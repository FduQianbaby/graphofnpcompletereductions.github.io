# A Graph of NP-Complete Reductions
This is a visualization of some NP-complete problems described by Gary and Johnson in *Computers and Intractability: a Guild to the Theory of NP-Completeness*. Even though the book is a great resource, we wanted to see what the reductions would look like displayed more naturally as a graph. 

Check it out at: https://graphofnpcompletereductions.github.io/.

The visualization is made possible by the [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3 "D3.js") javascript library. The math displays in the problem descriptors are made possible by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/ "MathJax"). If you would like to make your own simple web-based application with properly typeset mathematics, these libraries come highly recommended.
