# A Graph of NP-Complete Reductions
This is a visualization of some NP-complete problems described by Gary and Johnson in *Computers and Intractability: a Guild to the Theory of NP-Completeness*. Eventhough the book is a great resource, we wanted to see what the reductions would look like displayed more naturally as a graph. Each problem is represented by a labeled node. Problems related by a reduction are connected by an edge. The size of a node is proportional to its degree.
