ACM, 1971.",LG,"Remains NP-complete even if each \(c \in C\) satisfies \(|c|=3\) (3-SAT), or if each \(|c| \leq 3\) and, for each \(u \in U\), there are at most three clauses in \(C\) that contain either \(u\) or \(\bar{u}\).

1,3-Satisfiability,3-SAT,0,[LO2],"A set of \(m\) clauses - \(C_1 ,C_2,...,C_m\) - over a set of \(n\) Boolean valued variables \(X_n=\left\langle x_1,x_2,...,x_n\right\rangle\), such that each clause depends on exactly three distinct variables from \(X_n\). A clause being a Boolean expression of the form \(y_i+y_j+y_k\) where each \(y\) is of the form \(x\) or \(-x\) (i.e. negation of \(x\)) with \(x\) being some variable in \(X_n\). For example if \(n=4\) and \(m=3\) a possible instance could be the (set of) Boolean expressions: \(C_1=(x_1+(-x_2)+(-x_3))\); \(C_2=(x_2+x_3+(-x_4))\); \(C_3=((-x_1)+x_3+x_4)\). ","Can each variable \(x_i\) of \(X_n\) be assigned a boolean value \(\alpha_i\) in such a way that every clause evaluates to the boolean result true under the assignment \(\langle x_i:=\alpha_i:1\leq i\leq n \rangle\)? In the example instance, the assignment \(\langle x_1 := true, x_2 := false, x_3 := true, x_4 := false \rangle\) is such that each of the three clauses takes the value true.","Cook, Stephen A.

7,Chromatic Index (Edge Colouring) ,CI-EC,1,[GT66],"An \(n\)-node undirected graph \(G(V,E)\) with node set \(V\) and edge set \(E\); a positive integer \(k\) with \(k \leq |E|\).",Can the edges of \(G\) be assigned exactly one of \(k\) colours in such a way that no two edges which have a common node as an endpoint are assigned the same colour?,"Holyer, Ian. ""The NP-completeness of edge-coloring."" SIAM Journal on computing 10.4 (1981): 718-720.",GT,"Vizing's Theorem from graph theory shows that the only hard case for this problem is when \(k\) is equal to the maximum degree of \(G\). The degree of a node, \(v\), is the number of edges in the graph with \(v\) as an end-point; the degree of a graph is the maximum degree of any node in the graph. Chromatic Index was shown to be NP-complete soon after the 1979 edition of Garey and Johnson went to press, hence the OPEN categorisation. The classical paper on sequential methods is: A.M. Gibbons and O.A. Ogunyode: Optimal edge-colouring of almost all simple graphs in polynomial time. Random Graphs 1985: Conf. Record of 2nd International Seminar on Random Graphs and Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics, Poznan, North-Holland, (1985). There are also a number of methods presenting efficient parallel algorithms for various special types of graph. Some of the ideas presented in these may be useful in formulating sequential techniques, e.g. A.M. Gibbons and W. Rytter: Optimally edge-colouring outerplanar graphs is in NC.
