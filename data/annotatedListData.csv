SIAM journal on Computing 4.3 (1975): 226-248.",PO,"The background to this problem comes from developing Code Generation methods in compilers for High-Level Languages. On early architectures, performing arithmetic operations with both operands stored in registers was significantly faster than fetching an operand from main memory. Such machines, however, had only a small (16-32) number of fast registers. Thus in generating assembly code to represent the computation of a lengthy arithmetic expression, it was necessary to use registers efficiently. A common first stage in compiling such expressions was to represent the computation as a (so-called) `straight-line program' which in turn could be modelled as a directed acyclic graph.

For a given assignment of Boolean values to the variables \(X_n\) a path can be traced starting from the root of the decision tree and following the edges marked with the value of the variable labelling each node encountered.
